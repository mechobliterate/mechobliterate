## Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

My name is Josiah, and I am a Design Engineer and Entrepreneur based in New York City.

Throughout my engineering and entrepreneurial career, I have often been described as driven, passionate, and innovative. With this mindset, I have come to recognize the complex responsibilities it entails. I focus on optimizing processes for both present and emerging technologies, and I have a strong interest in business analytics and machine learning. By continuously challenging myself, I apply my problem-solving skills to develop unique solutions that not only achieve current goals but also have the potential to create meaningful, global impact.

Beyond technical execution, I maintain a strong commitment to continuous learning and personal growth and forward-looking thinking in a rapidly evolving technological landscapes. By staying engaged with emerging tools, methodologies, and industries, I aim to anticipate challenges before they arise and design solutions that remain relevant over time. This adaptability informs both my engineering practice and my entrepreneurial pursuits.

Previously, I worked at [The Browser Company](https://thebrowser.company) as the Head of Product. The Browser Company is a pioneering technology firm focused on reimagining how people experience the internet. Its flagship products, Arc and Dia, are next-generation web platforms that create more intuitive, powerful, and user-centric browsing experiences. At The Browser Company, I drove product vision, strategy, and execution, leading cross-functional teams across engineering, design, and research to deliver breakthrough user experiences. I also architected systems and processes that balanced rapid iteration with long-term technical resilience. I now serve as one of the ambassadors for their latest and future products, representing the brand and supporting its ongoing growth and innovation.

In this role, I define the company’s vision and strategy while overseeing product direction, engineering leadership, and operational execution. I am responsible for guiding technical architecture, setting quality and performance standards, and leading cross-functional teams to deliver scalable, resilient software systems. Working closely with engineers, designers, and partners, I align business objectives with technical execution to build adaptive, context-aware computing solutions that address today’s needs while shaping the future of human–computer interaction.
