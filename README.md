## Projects

Previously, I worked at [The Browser Company](https://thebrowser.company) as Chief Product Officer. The Browser Company is a pioneering technology firm focused on reimagining how people experience the internet. Its flagship products, Arc and Dia, are next-generation web platforms that create more intuitive, powerful, and user-centric browsing experiences. At The Browser Company, I drove product vision, strategy, and execution, leading cross-functional teams across engineering, design, and research to deliver breakthrough user experiences. I also architected systems and processes that balanced rapid iteration with long-term technical resilience. I now serve as Chairman of the Board, providing strategic oversight and guidance for the company’s continued growth and innovation.

Currently, I serve as the Founder & CEO of The Software Applications Company of New York, an independent company based in New York City focused on rethinking the personal computing experience. In this role, I define the company’s vision and strategy while overseeing product direction, engineering leadership, and operational execution. I am responsible for guiding technical architecture, setting quality and performance standards, and leading cross-functional teams to deliver scalable, resilient software systems. Working closely with engineers, designers, and partners, I align business objectives with technical execution to build adaptive, context-aware computing solutions that address today’s needs while shaping the future of human–computer interaction.
